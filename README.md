# First-Neural-Network

This is the first project of my Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation (Udacity). Using Numpy, I build a neural network that could predict the daily ridership of a bike sharing service.

To view my project most easily, click on the .ipynb link.

day.csv contains the ridership data on a daily basis.
hour.csv contains the ridership data on an hourly basis.

More information about the project can be found in Project_Description.txt.

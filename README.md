# First-Neural-Network
The first project in my Deep Learning Nanodegree (Udacity). Built a neural network using numpy.

Feel free to view the project in any of the three file types (.ipynb should be the most simple, just click on its link).

day.csv contains the ridership data on a daily basis.

hour.csv contains the ridership data on an hourly basis.


More information about the project can be found in Project_Description.txt.
